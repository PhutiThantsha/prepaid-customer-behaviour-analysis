# prepaid-customer-behaviour-analysis
Analysis of prepaid customer behaviour and revenue contribution using SQL and analytics techniques.

## Problem
Telecom prepaid environments require a clear understanding of customer behaviour
to identify consistent revenue drivers and irregular usage patterns.

## Data
This project focuses on analysis logic and methodology.
No real customer data is included.

All examples and structures are either synthetic or representative of
typical telecom datasets, used solely to demonstrate analytical approach.


## Approach
- Aggregated monthly customer KPIs using SQL
- Segmented customers into regular and irregular cohorts
- Analysed spend, purchase frequency, and usage behaviour
- Validated trends using descriptive statistics

## Key Insights
- A relatively small cohort of regular customers contributed a disproportionate share of revenue
- Irregular users exhibited volatile spend patterns and higher churn risk
- Behaviour-based segmentation provided clearer insights than single-month metrics

## Business Implications
- Enables targeted retention strategies for high-value customers
- Highlights upsell and reactivation opportunities for irregular users
- Supports data-driven prepaid product and CVM decisions

## Limitations
- Analysis based on aggregated historical data
- No real-time behavioural signals included
- Future work could incorporate lifecycle and predictive modelling
