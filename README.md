Analysis of prepaid customer behaviour and revenue contribution using SQL and analytics techniques.

# Prepaid Customer Behaviour & Segmentation Analysis

## Context
Prepaid telecom environments are highly dynamic, with customer behaviour
varying significantly across usage patterns, purchase frequency, and revenue contribution.
Understanding these behaviours is critical for customer value management (CVM) and prepaid product performance.

## Objective
To analyse prepaid customer behaviour and segment customers based on consistency
and usage patterns, in order to understand revenue contribution and inform
data-driven decision-making.

## Analytical Approach
The analysis focused on:
- Defining meaningful customer-level KPIs (activity, frequency, spend)
- Aggregating behaviour over time to avoid single-month bias
- Segmenting customers into regular and irregular usage cohorts
- Comparing revenue contribution and behavioural trends across segments

No real customer data was used or shared in this project.
The focus is on analytical logic and business reasoning.

## Key Insights
- A relatively small cohort of regular customers contributed a disproportionate share of prepaid revenue
- Irregular customers showed volatile behaviour and higher risk of churn
- Behavioural consistency provided stronger insights than point-in-time metrics

## Supporting Visuals
Illustrative visuals demonstrating customer segmentation, revenue contribution,
and behavioural trends are available in the /visuals folder.

Note: All visuals are created using synthetic data for demonstration purposes only.


## Business Implications
- Supports targeted retention strategies for high-value customers
- Highlights opportunities for reactivation and upsell within irregular segments
- Informs prepaid product optimisation and CVM strategy

## Limitations
- Analysis based on aggregated historical behaviour
- No real-time behavioural signals
- Results intended to demonstrate analytical thinking, not operational outputs
